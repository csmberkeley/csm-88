\question Implement {\tt \_\_add\_\_}, which takes in two vectors of
the same length and returns a new vector which is their sum. Try using
list comprehensions.
\begin{lstlisting}
def __add__(self, other):
    assert type(other) == Vector, "Invalid operation!"
    assert len(self) == len(other), "Invalid dimensions!"
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[3cm]
\begin{lstlisting}
    return Vector([self[n] + other[n] for n in range(len(self))])
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
