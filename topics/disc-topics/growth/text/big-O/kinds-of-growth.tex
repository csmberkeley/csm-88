Here are some common orders of growth, ranked from no growth to fastest growth:
\begin{itemize}
\item $O(1)$ --- constant time takes the same amount of time regardless of
  input size
\item $O(\log n)$ --- logarithmic time
\item $O(n)$ --- linear time
\item $O(n^2)$, $O(n^3)$, etc. --- polynomial time
\item $O(2^n)$ --- exponential time (considered ``intractable''; these are
    really, really horrible)
\end{itemize}
