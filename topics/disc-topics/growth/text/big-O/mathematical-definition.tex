The mathematical definition of big O is, for some values $k_1$ and $n$,
\begin{equation}
 R(n) \leq k_1 \times f(n)
\end{equation}
for $n > N$, where $N$ is sufficiently large.

Fortunately, in CS 61A, we're not that concerned with rigorous mathematical
proofs. (You'll get more details in CS 61B!) What we want you to develop in CS
61A is the intuition to reason out the orders of growth for certain functions.
