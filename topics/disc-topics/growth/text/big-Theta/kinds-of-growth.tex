Here are some common orders of growth, ranked from no growth to fastest growth:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Theta(1)$ --- constant time takes the same amount of time regardless of
  input size
\item $\Theta(\log n)$ --- logarithmic time
\item $\Theta(n)$ --- linear time
\item $\Theta(n\log n)$ --- linearithmic time
\item $\Theta(n^2)$, $\Theta(n^3)$, etc. --- polynomial time
\item $\Theta(2^n)$, $\Theta(3^n)$, etc. --- exponential time (considered
    ``intractable''; these are really, really horrible)
\end{itemize}

We can express growth in terms of any function of $n$ - for example,
$\Theta(n!)$ grows even more quickly than exponential time growth.
However, for this class, you should focus on the growth classes
above.

In addition, some programs will never terminate if they get stuck in an
infinite loop.
