Previously, we looked at the \texttt{is\_prime} function. Here's the code for it:

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}
def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False
    k = 2
    while k < n:
        if n % k == 0: 
            return False
        k += 1 
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

What is the order of growth of \texttt{is\_prime}?

\begin{solution} [0.5in]
    $O(n)$
\end{solution}

How can we change \texttt{is\_prime} so that it runs in $O(\sqrt{n})$?

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_prime(n):
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.0in]
If {\texttt n} is not prime, it can be factored into at least two factors. If both
of the factors are greater than the $\sqrt{n}$, then their product is greater
than \texttt{n}. Therefore, one of the factors must be less than or equal to
$\sqrt{n}$.
\begin{lstlisting}
    if n == 1:
        return False
    k = 2
    while k * k <= n:
        if n % k == 0:
            return False
        k += 1
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
