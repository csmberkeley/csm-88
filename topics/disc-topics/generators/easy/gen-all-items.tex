\question Write a generator function \texttt{gen\char`_all\char`_items} that
takes a list of iterators and yields items from all of them in order.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def gen_all_items(lst):
    """
    >>> nums = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [[5, 6]]]
    >>> num_iters = [iter(l) for l in nums]
    >>> list(gen_all_items(num_iters))
    [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    for it in lst:
        yield from it
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{yield from} solution is nice and short. But this can also be done
with just yield:
\begin{lstlisting}
    for it in lst:
        for x in it:
            yield x
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that this function will not yield out of deep lists. That is, it will
keep the brackets around deep lists and yield them together instead of one
element at a time.

For an extra challenge, figure out how to yield deep list items! (so the example
in the doctest would return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
\end{solution}
