A \define{generator function} is a special kind of Python function that uses a
\lstinline$yield$ statement instead of a \lstinline$return$ statement to report
values. \emph{When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, 
which is a type of iterator.} To the right, you can see a function that returns an 
iterator over the natural numbers.
