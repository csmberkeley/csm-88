When \lstinline$yield from$ is called on an iterator, it will \lstinline$yield$
every value from that iterator. It's similar to doing the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
for x in an_iterator:
    yield x
\end{lstlisting}

The example to the right demonstrates different ways of computing the same
result.
