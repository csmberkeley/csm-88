\question Write a generator function \texttt{generate\char`_subsets} that
returns all subsets of the positive integers from 1 to \lstinline$n$.
Each call to this generator's \lstinline$next$ method will return a list of
subsets of the set \lstinline$[1, 2, ..., n]$, where \lstinline$n$ is the number
of previous calls to \texttt{next}.

\begin{lstlisting}
def generate_subsets():
    """
    >>> subsets = generate_subsets()
    >>> for _ in range(3):
    ...     print(next(subsets))
    ...
    [[]]
    [[], [1]]
    [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    subsets = [[]]
    n = 1
    while True:
        yield subsets
        subsets = subsets + [s + [n] for s in subsets]
        n += 1
\end{lstlisting}
We start with a base list of subsets. To get the next sequence of subsets, we need two things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All current subsets will continue to be valid subsets in the future.
    \item We take all the subsets we currently have, and add the next number.
        These are also valid subsets.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}
