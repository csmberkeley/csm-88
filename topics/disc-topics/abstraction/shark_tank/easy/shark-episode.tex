\question 
Letâ€™s simulate a presentation by an aspiring entrepreneur.
In the pitch, the entrepreneur describes an idea 
to a panel (a list) of sharks.
If the idea is good
and any of the sharks has enough money for
the entrepreneur's request, the entrepreneur
succeeds!

Implement {\tt episode}, which prints the idea of the entrepreneur 
and then returns {\tt True} if any of the sharks fund it and {\tt False} otherwise.
Don't violate any data abstractions!

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
def episode(entrepreneur, shark):
    """Simulates a pitch from entrepreneur to shark
    >>> wfs = make_idea('Water-free shower', True)
    >>> nikki = make_entrepreneur(wfs, 100000)
    >>> sharks = [make_shark(100000000), make_shark(10000)]
    >>> result = episode(nikki, sharks)
    Water-free shower
    >>> result is True
    True
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    idea = get_idea(entrepreneur)
    print(get_name(idea))
    for shark in sharks:
        if is_good(idea) and get_money_request(entrepreneur) <= get_max_funding(shark):
            return True
    return False
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
