Data abstraction violations happen when we assume we know something about how
our data is represented. For example, if we use pairs and we forget to use a
selector and instead use the index.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> lauren = make_entrepreneur('CS61A App.', 2000000)
>>> print(lauren[0]) # violation!!!!
CS61A App.
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, we assume that {\tt lauren} is represented as a list because
we use the square bracket indexing. However, we should have used the selector
{\tt get\_idea}. This is a data abstraction violation.
