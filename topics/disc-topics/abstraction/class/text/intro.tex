The 61A TAs have decided to call upon the power of data abstraction to organize
their discussion sections. To do so, they've created a {\tt discussion}
abstract data type. A discussion contains three things:

\begin{itemize}
\item The name of the TA running the section
\item The time the section starts, given as an integer
\item A list of students enrolled in the section
\end{itemize}

Given this, the TAs come up with the following constructor and selectors:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{make\_discussion(ta, time, students)}: Creates and returns a new
discussion section.
\item \texttt{get\_ta(disc)}: Returns the TA running the given discussion section.
\item \texttt{get\_time(disc)}: Returns the start time of the given discussion
section.
\item \texttt{get\_students(disc)}: Returns the list of students enrolled in the
given discussion section.
\end{itemize}
