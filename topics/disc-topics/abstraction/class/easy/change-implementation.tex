\question
A disgruntled student makes changes to the discussion 
data abstraction in an attempt to disrupt the TAs' ability
to run section. The new implementation is as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
def make_discussion(ta, time, students):
    return {"ta" : ta, "time" : time,  "students" : students}

def get_ta(disc):
    return disc["ta"]

def get_time(disc):
    return disc["time"]

def get_students(disc):
    return disc["students"]
\end{lstlisting}

Would the code in the previous question, with the corrections
you made, still work with these changes? Would the code before
removing abstraction violations still work?

\begin{solution}
After removing the abstraction violations, the code will work 
correctly. This is because we don't assume anything about the
representation of a discussion object, so changing the 
representation doesn't affect anything.

Before, with abstraction violations, our code will no longer work 
correctly. When we try to index into a discussion as if it is a 
list, we will get an error, since it is now implemented as a 
dictionary.
\end{solution}
