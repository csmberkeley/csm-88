\question
The TAs have written the following code using the above data abstraction.
However, it contains some abstraction violations. Underline each occurence of
an abstraction violation. Then, if possible, write the correct line of code to the right.

\begin{lstlisting}
def check_start(disc1, disc2):
    """Checks whether disc1 and disc2 have the same starting time."""
    return disc1[1] == disc2[1]:

def print_students(disc):
    """Prints the name of each student in the discussion."""
    for student in disc[2]:
        print(student)

def print_duplicates(disc1, disc2):
     """Prints each student that attended both disc1 and disc2."""
    students_1, students_2 = get_students(disc1), get_students(disc2)
    for i in range(len(students_1)):
        if students_1[i] in students_2:
            print(students_1[i])
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[.5cm]
Below is the code with all abstraction violations removed. Notice that
{\tt print\_duplicates} did not contain any data abstraction violations.
\begin{lstlisting}
def check_start(disc1, disc2):
    return get_time(disc1) == get_time(disc2):

def print_students(disc):
    for student in get_students(disc2):
        print(student)

def print_duplicates(disc1, disc2):
    students_1, students_2 = get_students(disc1), get_students(disc2)
    for i in range(len(students_1)):
        if students_1[i] in students_2:
            print(students_1[i])
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
