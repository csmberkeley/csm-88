Data abstraction violations happen when we assume we know something about how
our data is represented. For example, if we use pairs and we forget to use a
selector and instead use the index.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> butter = make_item('Butter', 2)
>>> print(butter[0]) # violation!!!!
Butter
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, we assume that {\tt butter} is represented as a list because
we use the square bracket indexing. However, we should have used the selector
{\tt get\_item\_name}. This is a data abstraction violation.
