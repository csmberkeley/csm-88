One way to implement abstract data types is with the Python list construct.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> nums = [1, 2]
>>> nums[0]
1
>>> nums[1]
2
\end{lstlisting}

We use the square bracket notation to access the data we stored in
\texttt{nums}.  The data is \textit{zero indexed}: we access the first
element with {\tt nums[0]} and the second with {\tt nums[1]}.
