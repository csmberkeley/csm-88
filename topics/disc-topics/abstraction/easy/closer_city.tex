\question Implement {\tt closer\_city}, a function that takes a
latitude, longitude, and two cities, and returns the name of the city
that is relatively closer to the provided latitude and longitude.

You may only use selectors and constructors (introduced above) for
this question. You may also use the {\tt distance} function defined above.

\begin{lstlisting}
def closer_city(lat, lon, city1, city2):
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    new_city = make_city('arb', lat, lon)
    dist1 = distance(city1, new_city)
    dist2 = distance(city2, new_city)
    if dist1 < dist2:
        return get_name(city1)
    return get_name(city2)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
