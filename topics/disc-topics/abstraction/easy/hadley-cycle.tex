\question The Hadley Cycle describes the process of atmospheric circulation
caused by rising air at the equator and falling air at about 30 degrees North or
South. The air loses water vapor to rain as it rises from the equator.
Consequently, the falling cold air is dry, so that many regions around 30
degrees from the equator comprise of desert.

Write a function {\tt near\_thirty(city, diff)} that checks whether an input
{\tt city} is within {\tt diff} degrees of 30 degrees N or 30 degrees S.

\begin{lstlisting}
def near_thirty(city, diff):
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.0in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    city_latitude = get_lat(city)
    return abs(city_latitude - 30) <= diff or abs(city_latitude + 30) <= diff
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
