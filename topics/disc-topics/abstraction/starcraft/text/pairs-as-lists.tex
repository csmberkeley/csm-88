One way to implement abstract data types is with the Python list construct.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> nums = [1, 2]
>>> nums[0]
1
>>> nums[1]
2
\end{lstlisting}

We use the square bracket notation to access the data we stored in
\texttt{nums}.  The data is \textit{zero indexed}: we access the first
element with {\tt nums[0]} and the second with {\tt nums[1]}.

Let's now use data abstractions to recreate the popular video game Starcraft:
Brood War.  In Starcraft, the three races, Zerg, Protoss, and Terran, create
"units" that they send to attack each other.
