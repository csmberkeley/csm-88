Data abstraction violations happen when we assume we know something about how
our data is represented. For example, if we use pairs and we forget to use a
selector and instead use the index.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> raynor = make_unit('This is Jimmy.', 18)
>>> print(raynor[0]) # violation!!!!
This is Jimmy.
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, we assume that {\tt raynor} is represented as a list because
we use the square bracket indexing. However, we should have used the selector
{\tt get\_catchphrase}. This is a data abstraction violation.
