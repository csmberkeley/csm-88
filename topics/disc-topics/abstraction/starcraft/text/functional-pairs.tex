The second way of constructing abstract data types is with higher order functions. We can
implement the functions {\tt pair} and {\tt select} to achieve the same
goal.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> def pair(x, y):
        """Return a function that represents a pair of data."""
        def get(index):
            if index == 0:
                return x
            elif index == 1:
                return y
        return get
>>> def select(p, i):
        """Return the element at index i of pair p"""
        return p(i)
>>> nums = pair(1, 2)
>>> select(nums, 0)
1
>>> select(nums, 1)
2
\end{lstlisting}

Note how although using functional pairs is different syntactically from lists,
it accomplishes the exact same thing.

We can tie this in with our continuing Starcraft example. Units require
resources to create, and in Starcraft, these resources are called "minerals" and
"gas."
