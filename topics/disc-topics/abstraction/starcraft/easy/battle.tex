\question Let's simulate a battle between units! In a battle, each unit yells
its respective catchphrase, then the unit with more damage wins.
Implement {\tt battle}, which prints the catchphrases of the first and
second unit in that order, then returns the unit that does more damage.
The first unit wins ties. Don't violate any data abstractions!

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
def battle(first, second):
    """Simulates a battle between the first and second unit
    >>> zealot = make_unit('My life for Aiur!', 16)
    >>> zergling = make_unit('GRAAHHH!', 5)
    >>> winner = battle(zergling, zealot)
    GRAAHHH!
    My life for Aiur!
    >>> winner is zealot
    True
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    print(get_catchphrase(first))
    print(get_catchphrase(second))
    if get_damage(first) >= get_damage(second):
        return first
    return second
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
