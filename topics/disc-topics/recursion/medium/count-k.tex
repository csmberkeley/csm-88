\question Consider a special version of the \texttt{count\char`_stairways}
problem, where instead of taking 1 or 2 steps, we are able to take
\textbf{up to and including} \texttt{k} steps at a time.

Write a function \texttt{count\char`_k} that figures out the number of
paths for this scenario. Assume \texttt{n} and \texttt{k} are positive.

\begin{lstlisting}
def count_k(n, k):
    """
    >>> count_k(3, 3) # 3, 2 + 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 1 + 1
    4
    >>> count_k(4, 4)
    8
    >>> count_k(10, 3)
    274
    >>> count_k(300, 1) # Only one step at a time
    1
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 0
    else:
        total = 0
        i = 1
        while i <= k:
            total += count_k(n - i, k)
            i += 1
        return total
\end{lstlisting}
