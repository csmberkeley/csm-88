\question Consider an insect in an {\tt M} by {\tt N} grid. The insect starts at the bottom left corner, {\tt (0, 0)}, and wants to end up at the top right corner {\tt (M-1, N-1)}. The insect is only capable of moving right or up. Write a function {\tt paths} that takes a grid length and width and returns the number of different paths the insect can take from the start to the goal. (There is a closed-form solution to this problem, but try to answer it procedurally using recursion.)

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}
def paths(m, n):
    """
    >>> paths(2, 2)
    2
    >>> paths(117, 1)
    1
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

\begin{solution}[1.2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    if m == 1 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return paths(m - 1, n) + paths(m, n - 1)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
