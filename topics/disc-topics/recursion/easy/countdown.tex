\question Write a recursive function that takes in an integer {\tt n} and
prints out a countdown from {\tt n} to 1.

First, think about a base case for the {\tt countdown} function. What is
the simplest input the problem could be given?

\begin{solution}[0.35in]
When {\tt n} equals {\tt 0}
\end{solution}

After you've thought of a base case, think about a recursive call with a
smaller argument that approches the base case. What happens if you call
\texttt{countdown(n - 1)}?

\begin{solution}[0.35in]
A countdown starting from {\tt n - 1} is printed.
\end{solution}

\begin{blocksection}
Then, put the base case and the recursive call together, and think about
where a print statement would be needed.

\begin{lstlisting}
def countdown(n):
    """
    >>> countdown(3)
    3
    2
    1
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1.9in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    if n <= 0:
        return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)
\end{lstlisting}

\end{solution}
\end{blocksection}

\question How can we change {\tt countdown} to count up instead without
modifying a lot of the code?
\begin{solution}[0.7in]
Move the {\tt print} statement to after the recursive call. \\
