\question Implement the \texttt{unique-stream} procedure, which takes in a
stream and returns new stream that contains each element of the input stream
once. Only the first occurrence of each number should be included such that it is
in the order that it appears in the original stream. You may want to use
\texttt{filter-stream} defined below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (filter-stream f s)
  (cond
    ((null? s) nil)
    ((f (car s))
      (cons-stream (car s)
                    (filter-stream f (cdr-stream s))))
    (else (filter-stream f (cdr-stream s)))))

(define (unique-stream s)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
  (if (null? s) nil
      (cons-stream
        (car s)
        (unique-stream
          (filter-stream (lambda (x) (not (= x (car s))))
                          (cdr-stream s))))))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\texttt{take} is a procedure that returns a Scheme list containing the first \texttt{n} elements a stream \texttt{s}.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (take n s)
  (if (or (= n 0) (null? s))
    nil
    (cons (car s) (take (- n 1) (cdr-stream s)))))

scm> (take 10 (unique-stream (lst-to-stream '(1 3 2 3 4 2))))
(1 3 2 4)
scm> (take 10 (unique-stream (lst-to-stream '(4 4 5 5 6 5))))
(4 5 6)
\end{lstlisting}
