\question You're trying to re-organize your music library! The table
\texttt{tracks} below contains song titles and the corresponding album.
Create another table \texttt{tracklist} with two columns: the album and a
comma-separated list of all songs from that album in alphabetical order.

\medskip

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
CREATE TABLE tracks AS
  SELECT "Human" AS title  , "The Definition" AS album UNION
  SELECT "Simple and Sweet", "The Definition"          UNION
  SELECT "Paper Planes"    , "Translations Through Speakers";
\end{lstlisting}

\medskip

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
CREATE TABLE tracklist AS
  WITH songs(album, total) AS (

      ____________________________________________________________________________

    ),

    ____________________________________________________ AS (

      ____________________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________________

    )

    SELECT _______________________________________________________________________

      WHERE ______________________________________________________________________;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
CREATE TABLE tracklist AS
  WITH songs(album, total) AS (
      SELECT album, COUNT(*) FROM tracks GROUP BY album
    ),
    listing(album, songs_so_far, last_song, num_songs_so_far) AS (
      SELECT album, title, title, 1 FROM tracks UNION
      SELECT l.album, songs_so_far || ', ' || title, title, num_songs_so_far + 1
       FROM tracks AS t, listing AS l
       WHERE l.album = t.album AND title > last_song
    )
    SELECT l.album, l.songs_so_far
      FROM songs AS s, listing AS l
      WHERE s.album = l.album AND total = num_songs_so_far;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\medskip

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
sqlite3> SELECT * FROM tracklist ORDER BY album;
The Definition|Human, Simple and Sweet
Translations Through Speakers|Paper Planes
\end{lstlisting}
