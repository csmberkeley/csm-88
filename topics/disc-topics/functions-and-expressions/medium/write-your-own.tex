\question Write a function, \texttt{decades\_ago}, that takes a year in the
past (before 2017) and returns the number of decades that have passed since. A
function signature with a \textit{doctest} (an example execution) is below.
Fill it in so that the doctest will pass!

\begin{lstlisting}
def decades_ago(year):
    """Returns the number of decades that have passed between
    the year and 2017.

    >>> decades_ago(1995)
    2.2
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
Many solutions are possible, but here's one:
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{lstlisting}
def decades_ago(year):
    years_ago = 2017 - year
    return years_ago / 10
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
