\question What would Python display?

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> def cake(batter):
...     return batter
>>> def pan(x, y):
...     y = y + 20
...     return x(y)
>>> pan(print, 10)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\texttt{30}

We did something tricky here--we passed a function (\texttt{print}) into another
function (\texttt{pan}), where it was bound to the local variable \texttt{x}. We
then called \texttt{x(y)}, which actually executes \texttt{print(y)}.
Passing functions as arguments is something we'll discuss more in the future.
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> pan(cake, cake(30))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\texttt{50}
\end{solution}
