\begin{enumerate}
\item Pure functions have no side effects -- they only produce a return value.
    They will always evaluate to the same result, given the same argument
    value(s).
\item Non-pure functions produce side effects, such as printing to your
    terminal.
\end{enumerate}

Later in the semester, we will expand on the notion of a pure function
versus a non-pure function.
