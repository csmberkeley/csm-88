Writing and calling functions is a crucial part in manage complexity when
programming.

Functions allow us to apply a series of statements to some arguments to produce
a return value. For, example, let's take a look at the built-in \texttt{abs}
function:

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> abs(123)
123
>>> abs(-2000)
2000
\end{lstlisting}

This function takes in one argument, a number, and returns its absolute value.
Since this is a built-in function, we don't know what statements were executed
to obtain this output. The expressions above are known as call expressions.
