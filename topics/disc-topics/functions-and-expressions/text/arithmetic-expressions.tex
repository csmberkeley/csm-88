\define{Arithmetic expressions} in Python are very similar to ones we've seen
in other math contexts. They involve binary arithmetic operators (\texttt{+},
\texttt{-}, \texttt{*}, \texttt{/}, \texttt{//}, \texttt{\%}, and \texttt{**})
and follow PEMDAS rules.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> 6 + 2 * 5
16
>>> 9 // 2     # Floor division (rounding down)
4
>>> 9 % 2      # Modulus (remainder of 9 // 2)
1
>>> (3 + 2) * 4 // 3
6
>>> 4 ** 3     # Exponent
64
\end{lstlisting}
