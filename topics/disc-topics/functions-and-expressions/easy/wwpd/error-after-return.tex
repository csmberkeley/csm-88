% - `return` statements terminate evaluation

\begin{blocksection}
\question
What is the result of evaluating the following code?

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> from operator import add
>>> def square(x):
...     return x * x
>>> def fun(num):
...     return num
...     num / 0
>>> square(fun(5))
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
25

Note that although \texttt{num / 0} would throw an exception
\textit{if executed}, this code runs error-free because the function always
returns before reaching that line.
\end{solution}
