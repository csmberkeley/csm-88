\question Determine the result of evaluating \texttt{foo(5)} in the Python
interpreter if the following functions are defined in the order below:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> def bar(param):
...     return param
>>> bar = 6
>>> def foo(bar):
...     return bar(bar)
>>> bar = 7
>>> foo(5)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
When we evaluate \texttt{foo(5)}, the name \texttt{bar} will be bound to 5
inside the function \texttt{foo}. Next, Python will try to evaluate
\texttt{bar(bar)}, or \texttt{5(5)}. This will cause an error when we apply 5
as a function onto 5 because integers are not functions.
\end{solution}
