\question Now, let's practice defining functions. In the space below, write a
function called \texttt{square\_diff} that takes in two integer arguments and
returns the result of squaring the difference between the arguments. You may
name the parameters whatever you'd like. Be sure to use proper Python syntax!

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> square_diff(4, 1)
9
>>> square_diff(2, 7)
25
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
def square_diff(a, b):
    diff = a - b
    return diff * diff
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
