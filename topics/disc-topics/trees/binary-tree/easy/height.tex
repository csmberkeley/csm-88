\question Define a function {\tt height(t)} that returns the height of a
BinTree.  The height is defined as the length of the {\it longest} path from
the root node down to a leaf node. If a BinTree just consists of a root with
no children, its height is 0.

\begin{lstlisting}
def height(t):
    """Returns the height of the BinTree t."""
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1.75in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    result = 0
    if t.left != BinTree.empty:
        result = 1 + height(t.left)
    if  t.right != BinTree.empty:
        result = max(1 + height(t.right), result)
    return result
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
