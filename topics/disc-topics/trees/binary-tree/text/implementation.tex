Sometimes, it is more convenient to work with trees that have at most
two subtrees per node. Instead of using a list to keep track of all the
subtrees, we can use \texttt{left} and \texttt{right} to refer two the only two
subtrees in a \texttt{BinTree}.

% new binary tre class.
\begin{lstlisting}
class BinTree:
    empty = ()
    def __init__(self, entry, left=empty, right=empty):
        if left: assert isinstance(left, BinTree)
        if right: assert isinstance(right, BinTree)
        self.entry = entry
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
\end{lstlisting}
