\question Define a function \texttt{square\_tree(t)} that squares every value in
the non-empty tree \texttt{t}. You can assume that every value is a number.

\begin{lstlisting}
def square_tree(t):
    """Mutates a Tree t by squaring all its elements."""
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.7in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    t.label = t.label ** 2
    for branch in t.branches:
        square_tree(branch)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
