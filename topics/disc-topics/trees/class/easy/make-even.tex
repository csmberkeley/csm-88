\question Define a function \texttt{make\_even} which takes in a tree
\texttt{t} whose values are integers, and mutates the tree such that all the
odd integers are increased by 1 and all the even integers remain the same.

\begin{lstlisting}
def make_even(t):
    """
    >>> t = Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(3)]), Tree(4), Tree(5)])
    >>> make_even(t)
    >>> t.label
    2
    >>> t.branches[0].branches[0].label
    4
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1.10in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    if t.label % 2 != 0:
        t.label += 1
    for branch in t.branches:
        make_even(branch)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
