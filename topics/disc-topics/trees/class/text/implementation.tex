Recall the tree abstract data type: a tree is defined as having a label and
some branches. Previously, we implemented the tree abstraction using Python
lists.  Let's look at another implementation using objects instead:

\begin{lstlisting}
class Tree:
    def __init__(self, label, branches=[]):
        for b in branches:
            assert isinstance(b, Tree)
        self.label = label
        self.branches = branches

    def is_leaf(self):
        return not self.branches
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that with this implementation we can mutate a tree using attribute
assignment, which wasn't possible in the previous implementation using lists.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> t = Tree(3, [Tree(4), Tree(5)])
>>> t.label = 5
>>> t.label
5
\end{lstlisting}
