\question Write a function that combines the values of two
trees \texttt{t1} and \texttt{t2} together with the \texttt{combiner}
function. Assume that \texttt{t1} and \texttt{t2} have identical structure. This function should return a new tree.
\begin{lstlisting}
def combine_tree(t1, t2, combiner):
    """
    >>> a = Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(3)])])
    >>> b = Tree(4, [Tree(5, [Tree(6)])])
    >>> combined = combine_tree(a, b, mul)
    >>> combined.root
    4
    >>> combined.branches[0].root
    10
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    combined = [combine_tree(b1, b2, combiner) for b1, b2
                in zip(t1.branches, t2.branches)]
    return Tree(combiner(t1.root, t2.root), combined)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
