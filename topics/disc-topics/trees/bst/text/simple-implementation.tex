A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special kind of tree that satisfies the
following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every node of a BST has at most two children called \texttt{left} and \texttt{right}. The children are also BST's.
\item For every node, all values in the left child are less than or equal to the parent's value.
\item For every node, all values in the right child are greater than or equal to the parent's value.
\end{itemize}

% new binary tree class.
\begin{lstlisting}
# Binary Search Tree (BST) Class
class BinTree:
    empty = ()
    def __init__(self, root, left=empty, right=empty):
        self.root = root
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
\end{lstlisting}

Note that there is an empty tree (\texttt{BinTree.empty}) defined. If a node
does not have a left or right child, that attribute will be an empty tree.
