A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special kind of tree that satisfies the
following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Every node of a BST has at most two branches called \texttt{left} and \texttt{right}. The branches are also BSTs.
\item For every node, the left branch's value is less than or equal to its parent's value.
\item For every node, the right branch's value is greater than its parent's value.
\end{itemize}

# Binary Search Tree (BST) Class
class BST:
    empty = ()
    def __init__(self, root, left=empty, right=empty):
        assert left is BST.empty or isinstance(left, BST)
        assert right is BST.empty or isinstance(right, BST)

        self.root = root
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

        if left is not BST.empty:
            assert left.max <= root
        if right is not BST.empty:
            assert root < right.min

        if self.right is BST.empty:
            return self.root
        return self.right.max

    @property
    def min(self):
        if self.left is BST.empty:
            return self.root
        return self.left.min
