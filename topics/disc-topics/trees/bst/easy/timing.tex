\question 
Below are two binary search trees containing the same data. The tree on the left is as shallow as
possible, while the tree on the right is as deep as
possible. Suppose you have a function \texttt{tree\_find(t, x)} that returns
\texttt{True} when \texttt{x} is in binary search tree \texttt{t},
\texttt{False} otherwise.

\begin{center}
\begin{lstlisting}
       6                2
      / \                \
     /   \                3
    3     9                \
   / \   / \                5
  2   5 8   13               \
                              6
                               \
                               ...
\end{lstlisting}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item
How long does \texttt{tree\_find} take to run on the shallower tree? And the other tree? Write your answer as a function of $N$, the number of entries in the tree.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$O(log(n))$ for the shallower tree; $O(n)$ for the deeper tree, as it can be
viewed as a link list. 
\end{solution}

\item 
How long does \texttt{tree\_find} take to run on the shallower tree? Write your answer as a function of $H$, the height of the tree.
\begin{solution}[0.5in]
$O(H)$ for both trees.
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}

% Cannot generate a correct tree if there's only one child, hence switching to
