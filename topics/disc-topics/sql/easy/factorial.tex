Write a query that creates a table called \texttt{factorials}, which has a
single column, and a row for each factorial for the numbers 0 to 10 (inclusive).
To do this, create a local table with two columns: the first column is the
numbers 0 to 10 (inclusive), and the second column is their factorials.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
create table factorials as
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[3.5cm]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
  with fact(n, nfact) as (
    select 0, 1 union
    select n + 1, nfact * (n + 1) from fact where n < 10
  )
  select nfact from fact;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
sqlite> select * from factorials;
1
