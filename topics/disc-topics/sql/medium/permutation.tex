\question Generate a table that contains all the permutations of length 3 from
the set {0, 1, 2, 3}. Your solution should have three columns named p, q, r.
Hint: Use the \texttt{natural} table defined earlier.

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
create table permutation as
  select a.n as p, b.n as q, c.n as r from
    natural as a, natural as b, natural as c;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
