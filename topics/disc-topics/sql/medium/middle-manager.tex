\end{solution}

\question What is the output of the query in the previous part? Explain the
output you get.
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
Alyssa P Hacker
Ben Bitdiddle
Ben Bitdiddle
Ben Bitdiddle
Eben Scrooge
\end{lstlisting}
There are multiple people with Ben Bitdiddle as supervisor, and joining tables
together does not remove these duplicates. If we wanted to remove duplicates, we
could use the \texttt{DISTINCT} keyword.\\
