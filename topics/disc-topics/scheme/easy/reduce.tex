\question Define {\tt reduce}, where the first argument is a function that takes
two arguments, the second is a starting value, and the third is a list. This should
work like \textbf{Python}'s {\tt reduce}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (reduce fn s lst)



                                             )
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (reduce fn s lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        s
        (reduce fn (fn s (car lst)) (cdr lst))))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
