\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{=} can only be used for comparing numbers.
    \item \texttt{eq?} behaves like \texttt{==} in Python for comparing two
        non-pairs (numbers, booleans, etc.).
        Otherwise, \texttt{eq?} behaves like \texttt{is} in Python.
    \item \texttt{equal?} compares pairs by determining if their \texttt{car}s
        are \texttt{equal?} and their \texttt{cdr}s are \texttt{equal?}(that is, they
        have the same contents). Otherwise, \texttt{equal?} behaves like
        \texttt{eq?}.
