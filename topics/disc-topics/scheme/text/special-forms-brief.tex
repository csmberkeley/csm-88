Special forms are types of expressions with unique evaluation rules that can do a variety of things. Often times, speical forms are analagous to statements in Python, such as assignment statements, \texttt{if} statements, and \texttt{def} statements. However, all special forms in Scheme evaluate to a value. We'll learn more about special forms later in the discussion.
