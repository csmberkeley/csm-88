In Scheme, any expression that is quoted is \textbf{not} evaluated, making it a symbol. A
quoted expression is one that has \lstinline{'} preceding the expression.

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
scm> (define b 3)
b
scm> (define a 'b)
a
scm> a
b                       ; a is not 3
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

We will see later in discussion that quotation also allows us to construct a
list of quoted elements, using the conventional printed representation for
lists.

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}
scm> '(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
scm> '(a b c)
(a b c)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}
