Scheme has a set of \emph{atomic} primitive expressions. Atomic means
that these expressions cannot be divided up.

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
scm> 123
123
scm> #t
True
scm> #f
False
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}

Unlike in Python, the only primitive in Scheme that is a false value is
\lstinline{#f} and its equivalents, \lstinline{false} and \lstinline{False}. \textbf{This means that 0 is not false.}
