Primitive expressions in Scheme include self-evaluating expressions, like
numbers and booleans, and symbols.

All non-primitive expressions in Scheme are \define{combinations}. These are
expressions that combine other expressions in a set of parentheses like so:

\centerline{\lstinline{(<operator> <operand1> <operand2> ...)}}

where \texttt{<operator>}, \texttt{<operand1>}, \texttt{<operand2>} are all
Scheme expressions. A combination can have zero or more operands, but it must
have an operator.

Combinations are one of two things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \define{Call expressions}, if the \texttt{<operator>} is a
procedure.
\item \define{Special form expressions}, if the \texttt{<operator>} is
a special form.
\end{enumerate}
