In the next part of the course, we will be working with the \textbf{Scheme}
programming language. In addition to learning how to write Scheme programs, we
will eventually write a Scheme interpreter in Project 4!

Scheme is a dialect of the \textbf{Lisp} programming language, a language dating
back to 1958. The popularity of Scheme within the programming language community
stems from its simplicity -- in fact, previous versions of CS 61A were taught in
the Scheme language.
