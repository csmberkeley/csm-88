\question A \textbf{run-length encoding} is a method of compressing a sequence
of letters. The list \texttt{(a a a b a a a a)} can be compressed to \texttt{((a
  3) (b 1) (a 4))}, where the compressed version of the sequence keeps track of
how many letters appear consecutively.

Write a function that takes a compressed sequence and expands it into the
original sequence.
\textit{Hint:} You may want to use \texttt{concat} and \texttt{replicate}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (uncompress s)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
  (if (null? s)
    s
    (concat (replicate (car (car s)) (car (cdr (car s))))
            (uncompress (cdr s)))))
\end{lstlisting}

\end{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
scm> (uncompress '((a 1) (b 2) (c 3)))
(a b b c c c)
\end{lstlisting}
