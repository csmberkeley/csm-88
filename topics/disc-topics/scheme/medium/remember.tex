Define \texttt{remember}, a function that takes in another zero-argument function \texttt{f}, and returns another function \texttt{g}. When called for the first time, \texttt{g} will call \texttt{f} and pass on its return value. When called subsequent times, \texttt{g} will remember its previous return value and return it directly, without calling \texttt{f} again.

(Hint: look up \texttt{set!} in the Scheme spec!)

\begin{lstlisting}
(define (remember f)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
\begin{lstlisting}
  (define remembered? #f)
  (define remembered nil)
  (lambda ()
    (if remembered?
        remembered
        (begin (set! remembered (f))
               (set! remembered? #t)
               remembered)))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
)
scm> (define (f) (print "hello!") 5)
scm> (define g (remember f))
scm> (f)
hello!
5
scm> (g)
hello!
5
scm> (g)
5
\end{lstlisting}
