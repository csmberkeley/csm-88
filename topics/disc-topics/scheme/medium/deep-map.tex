\question Write a function that takes a procedure and applies to every
element in a given nested list.

The result should be a nested list with the same structure as the input list,
but with each element replaced by the result of applying the procedure to that
element.

Use the built-in \texttt{list?} procedure to detect whether a value is a list.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (deep-map fn lst)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
  (cond ((null? lst) lst)
        ((list? (car lst)) (cons (deep-map fn (car lst)) (deep-map fn (cdr lst))))
        (else (cons (fn (car lst)) (deep-map fn (cdr lst))))
        )
   )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
scm> (deep-map (lambda (x) (* x x)) '(1 2 3))
(1 4 9)
scm> (deep-map (lambda (x) (* x x)) '(1 ((4) 5) 9))
(1 ((16) 25) 81)
\end{lstlisting}
%scm> (deep-map (lambda (x) (* x x)) 2) Test case removed for clarity, as lst should technically initially be a list
