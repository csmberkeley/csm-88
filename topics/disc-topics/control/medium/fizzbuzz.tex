\question Implement \lstinline$fizzbuzz(n)$, which prints numbers from 1
to \lstinline$n$ (inclusive). However, for numbers divisible by 3, print
``fizz''. For numbers divisible by 5, print ``buzz''. For numbers
divisible by both 3 and 5, print ``fizzbuzz''.

This is a standard software engineering interview question, but we're confident in your ability to solve it!
