Python also includes the \define{boolean operators} \texttt{and}, \texttt{or},
and \texttt{not}. These operators are used to combine and manipulate boolean
values.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{not} returns the opposite truth value of the following expression.
    \item \texttt{and} stops evaluating any more expressions (short-circuits)
        once it reaches the first false value and returns it. If all values
        evaluate to a true value, the last value is returned.
    \item \texttt{or} short-circuits at the first true value and returns it. If
        all values evaluate to a false value, the last value is returned.
\end{itemize}
