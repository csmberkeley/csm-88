To repeat the same statements multiple times in a program, we can use
iteration.  In Python, one way we can do this is with a \define{\texttt{while}
loop}.

As long as \texttt{ <conditional clause> } evaluates to a true value,
\texttt{<body of statements>} will continue to be executed. The conditional
clause gets evaluated each time the body finishes executing.
