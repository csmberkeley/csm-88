\question What is the result of evaluating the following code?

\begin{lstlisting}
def square(x):
    print("here!")
    return x * x

def so_slow(num):
    x = num
    while x > 0:
        x = x + 1
    return x / 0

square(so_slow(5))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.25in]
Infinite loop because \lstinline$x$ will always be greater than 0; the
\lstinline$num / 0$ is never executed. We also know that \texttt{here!}
is never printed since the operand \texttt{so\_slow(5)} must be evaluated
before \texttt{function square(x)} can be called. \\
