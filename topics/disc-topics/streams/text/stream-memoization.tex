This implementation of streams also uses \emph{memoization}, or caching.
The first time a program asks a \lstinline$Stream$ for its \lstinline$rest$,
the \lstinline$Stream$ code computes the required value using
\lstinline$compute_rest$, saves the resulting value, and then returns it.
After that, every time the \lstinline$rest$ is referenced, we simply return
the value that we stored earlier.
