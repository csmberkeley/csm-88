Stream processing functions can be higher-order, abstracting a general
computational process over streams. Take a look at \texttt{filter\_stream}:

\begin{lstlisting}
def filter_stream(filter_func, s):
    def compute_rest():
        return filter_stream(filter_func, s.rest)
    if s is Stream.empty:
        return s
    elif filter_func(s.first):
        return Stream(s.first, compute_rest)
    else:
        return compute_rest()
\end{lstlisting}

The Stream we create has as its \texttt{compute\_rest} a function that
``promises'' to filter the rest of the Stream when called. So at any one point,
the entire stream has not been filtered. Instead, only the part that has been
referenced has been filtered.
