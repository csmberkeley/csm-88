In the example below, we start out with a \lstinline$Stream$ whose first
element is \lstinline$n$, and whose \lstinline$compute_rest$ function creates
another stream.
When we do compute the \lstinline$rest$, we get another \lstinline$Stream$.
It's first element will be \lstinline$n+1$, and it's \lstinline$compute_rest$
function will create a third \lstinline$Stream$.
This third \lstinline$Stream$ will start at \lstinline$n+2$, and its
\lstinline$compute_rest$ will make a fourth \lstinline$Stream$, and so on.
We get an infinite stream of integers, computed one at a time.
