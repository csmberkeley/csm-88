\question Suppose you want an infinite stream of randomly generated numbers.
Consider an attempt to implement this via the code below.
Are there any problems with this? If so, how can we fix it?

\begin{lstlisting}
from random import random
random_stream = Stream(random(), lambda: random_stream)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[2cm]
The provided code will generate a single random number, and then produce an
infinite stream which simply repeats that one number over and over. To fix this,
we can make this into a function that returns a Stream:
\begin{lstlisting}
def random_stream():
    return Stream(random(), random_stream)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
