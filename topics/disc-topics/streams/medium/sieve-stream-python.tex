\question We can even represent the sequence of all prime numbers as an
infinite stream!
Define a function \lstinline$sieve$, which takes in a stream of numbers and
returns a new stream containing only those numbers which are not multiples of
an earlier number in the stream.
We can define \lstinline$primes$ by sifting all natural numbers starting at 2.
Look online for the \textbf{Sieve of Eratosthenes} if you need some inspiration.

\begin{lstlisting}
def sieve(s):
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2cm]
\begin{lstlisting}
    no_multiples = filter_stream(lambda x: x % s.first != 0, s)
    return Stream(s.first, lambda: sieve(no_multiples))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
