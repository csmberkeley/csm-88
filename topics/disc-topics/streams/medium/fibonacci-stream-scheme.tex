\question The Fibonacci sequence is a classic infinite sequence. Implement
\texttt{make-fib-stream}, which takes two numbers and produces a stream of
Fibonacci numbers starting with those two numbers.
\newline
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (make-fib-stream a b)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2cm]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
  (cons-stream a (make-fib-stream b (+ a b))))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
scm> (define fib-stream (make-fib-stream 0 1))
fib-stream
scm> (car (cdr-stream (cdr-stream (cdr-stream (cdr-stream (cdr-stream fib-stream))))))
