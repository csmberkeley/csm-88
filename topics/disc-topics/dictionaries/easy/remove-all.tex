\question Given a (non-nested) dictionary {\tt d}, write a function which deletes all occurrences of {\tt x} as a value. You cannot delete items in a dictionary as you are iterating through it.
\begin{lstlisting}
def remove_all(d, x):
    """
    >>> d = {1:2, 2:3, 3:2, 4:3}
    >>> remove_all(d, 2)
    >>> d
    {2: 3, 4: 3}
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.8in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    keys_to_delete = [key for key in d if d[key] == x]
    for key in keys_to_delete:
        del d[key]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
