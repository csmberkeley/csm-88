One way a higher order function can manipulate other functions is by taking
functions as input (an argument). Consider this higher order function called
\texttt{negate}.

\texttt{negate} takes in a function \texttt{f} and a number \texttt{x}. It doesn't care what exactly \texttt{f} does, as long as \texttt{f} is a function, takes in a number and returns a number. Its job is simple: call \texttt{f} on \texttt{x} and return the negation of that value.
