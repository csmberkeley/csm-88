A \define{higher order function} (HOF) is a function that does at least one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{accepts} at least one function as an argument
    \item \emph{returns} a function
\end{itemize}

HOFs utilize the concept of treating \define{functions} as \emph{data} just like any type of value such as integers, strings, lists, booleans, etc. 

% A \define{higher order function} (HOF) is a function that manipulates other functions by taking in functions as arguments, returning a function, or both.
