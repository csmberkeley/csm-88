Sequences also have a notion of length, the number of items stored in
the sequence. In Python, we can check how long a sequence is with the
\texttt{len} built-in function.

We can also check if an item exists within a list with the \texttt{in}
statement.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> poke_team = ['Meowth', 'Mewtwo']
>>> len(poke_team)
2
>>> 'Meowth' in poke_team
True
>>> 'Pikachu' in poke_team
False
\end{lstlisting}
