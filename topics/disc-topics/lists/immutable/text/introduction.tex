In Python, we have \textit{lists}, which are ordered collections of whatever values we want, be it
numbers, strings, functions, or even other lists!

Lists can be created using square braces. Their elements can be
accessed (or \textit{indexed}) with square braces. Lists are
zero-indexed: to access the first element, we must index at 0; to access
the $i$th element, we must index at $i - 1$.

We can also index with negative numbers. These begin indexing at the
end of the list, so the index $-1$ is equivalent to the index
\texttt{len(list) - 1} and index $-2$ is the same as
\texttt{len(list) - 2}.

Examples:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> pokemon_team = ['pikachu', 'dratini']
>>> print(pokemon_team)
['pikachu', 'dratini']
>>> pokemon_team[0]
'pikachu'
>>> pokemon_team[-1]
'dratini'
\end{lstlisting}
