If we have two lists, we can use the + operator to create a new list with the
values of the original two lists, concatenated together.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> fish_names = ['Dory', 'Flounder']
>>> rabbit_names = ['Bugs Bunny', 'Officer Hopps']
>>> animal_names = fish_names + rabbit_names
>>> animal_names
['Dory', 'Flounder', 'Bugs Bunny', 'Officer Hopps']
\end{lstlisting}
