Many times, we wish an operation to be applied to all elements of a list.
Python has built-in methods to help us with these tasks. ({\it Note:} reduce
was hidden in Python 3.)

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt map(fn, lst)} applies fn to each element in lst
\item {\tt filter(pred, lst)} keeps those elements in lst that satisfy the
predicate
\item {\tt reduce(accum, lst, zero\_value)} repeatedly calls the accumulator
function, which takes in two arguments and returns a single value, on elements
of lst.
\end{itemize}

An important thing to note is that these operators do not change the input list, and they also do not return lists. You must call the {\tt list} operator on them to get a list back.
