There are two common methods of looping through lists.  If you don't need
indices, looping over elements is usually more clear.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt for el in lst} loops through the elements in {\tt lst}
\item {\tt for i in range(len(lst))} loops through the valid, positive indices
of {\tt lst}
\end{itemize}
