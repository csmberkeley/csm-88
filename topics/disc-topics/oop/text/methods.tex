To define a method, we write it almost exactly the same way as when we define
functions. However, the first argument we always include is \texttt{self}, which
we use to refer to the instance we used to call the method.
\begin{lstlisting}
class OurClass(ParentClass):
    def method(self, arg):
        # body goes here
\end{lstlisting}
