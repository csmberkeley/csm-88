When defining a class, we use the following syntax:
\begin{lstlisting}
class OurClass(ParentClass):
    """Class definition with methods and class attributes"""
\end{lstlisting}
where \texttt{OurClass} is the name of the new class and \texttt{ParentClass} is
the name of the class it inherits from. (We'll talk more about inheritance
later). When the \texttt{ParentClass} field is missing (i.e.\ just \texttt{class
OurClass:}), classes inherit from Python's built-in \texttt{object} class.
