\question Write a new method for the \texttt{Bag} class called {\tt
take\_color}, which takes a color and removes (and returns) a \texttt{Skittle}
of that color from the bag. If there is no \texttt{Skittle} of that color, then
it returns {\tt None}.

\begin{lstlisting}
    def take_color(self, color):
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[2 in]
\begin{lstlisting}
        for i in range(len(self.skittles)):
            curr_skittle = self.skittles[i].color
            if curr_skittle == color:
                return self.skittles.pop(i)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
