An interpreter is a program that understands other programs. Today, we will
explore how to interpret a simple language that uses Scheme syntax called
\textit{Calculator}.

The Calculator language includes only the four basic arithmetic operations:
$+$, $-$, $*$, and $/$. These operations can be nested and can take any numbers
of arguments. A few examples of calculator expressions and their corresponding
values are given on the right.
