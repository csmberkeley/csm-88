Let's extend the functionality of our Calculator interpreter to allow us to
define new variables and functions. We want this to work the same way as how we
would bind a symbol to a value in Scheme, e.g.: {\tt (define x (+ 3 4))}.

Using our current {\tt calc\_eval} implementation, we would map {\tt calc\_eval}
on each argument in {\tt exp.second}. However, in the example above, we should
not call {\tt calc\_eval} on {\tt x}. Hence, we introduce special forms.

First, we will implement {\tt do\_define\_form}, which will allow us to bind
symbols to values. Then, we will implement {\tt do\_lambda\_form}, which will allow us
to create user-defined functions.
