\question How many calls to {\tt calc\_eval} and {\tt calc\_apply} would it
take to evaluate each of the following Calculator expressions?

\begin{lstlisting}
> (+ 2 4 6 8)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.2in]
6 calls to eval: 1 for the entire expression, and then 1 each for the operator
and each operand.

1 call to apply the addition operator.
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
> (+ 2 (* 4 (- 6 8)))
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.2in]
10 calls to eval: 1 for the whole expression, then 1 for each of the operators
and operands. When we encounter another call expression, we have to evaluate
the operators and operands inside as well.

3 calls to apply the function to the arguments for each call expression.\\
