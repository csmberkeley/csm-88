\question Albert and Mark also use their own grade objects to store
grades. Here are the definitions for their grade classes:

\begin{lstlisting}
class AlbertGrade:
    def __init__(self, total_points):
        if total_points > 90:
            letter_grade = 'A'
        else:
            letter_grade = 'F'
        self.grade_info = (total_points, letter_grade)

class MarkGrade:
    def __init__(self, total_points):
        self.grade_info = total_points
\end{lstlisting}

Write a function {\tt compute\_average\_total}, which takes in a list
of records (that could be formatted via either standard) and computes
the average total points of all the students in the list.
\begin{solution}[.2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
type_tag.tags[AlbertGrade] = 'AW'
type_tag.tags[MarkGrade] = 'MM'

def get_points(grade):
    data_type = type_tag(grade)
    return get_points.implementations[data_type](grade)
def compute_average_total(records):
    total = 0
    for record in records:
        grade = get_grade(record)
        total += get_points(grade)
    return total / len(records)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
