\question John needs you to convert all student records into
the format that he uses. Unlike Albert and Mark, John is actually
helpful and provides the class definition of his formatted student
records. Unfortunately, his email was corrupted so you can only see the
first few lines of his class definition:

\begin{lstlisting}
class JohnGrade:
    """A student record formatted via John's standard"""
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        """NOTE: name must be a string, grade must be a number"""

\end{lstlisting}

Write a function {\tt johnify} which takes a list of student records
formatted either using Albert's or Mark's standard, and returns a list
of the same student records formatted using John's standard.

\begin{lstlisting}
def johnify(records):
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[.2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
    gradebook = []
    for record in records:
        name = get_name(record)
        points = get_points(get_grade(record))
        gradebook.append(JohnGrade(name, points))
    return gradebook
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
