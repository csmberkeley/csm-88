The TAs have broken out in a cold war; apparently, at the last
midterm-grading session, someone ate the last piece of sushi and
refused to admit it. It is near the end of the semester, and John
really needs to enter the grades.  Unfortunately, the TAs represent the
grades of their students differently, and refuse to change their
representation to someone else's. John has asked you to look into
writing generic functions for Albert's and Mark's student records.
