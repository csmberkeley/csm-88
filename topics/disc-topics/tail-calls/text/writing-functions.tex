\subsection*{Writing tail recursive functions}

Before we jump into questions, a quick tip for defining tail recursive functions
is to use helper functions. This is so that we can keep track of extra parameters
and make all recursive calls in tail context. Examples of such parameters include
something like \texttt{total}, \texttt{counter}, or \texttt{result}, like we saw
in \texttt{fact-tail}.
