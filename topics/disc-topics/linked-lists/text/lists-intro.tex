There are many different implementations of sequences in Python. Today, we'll
explore the linked list implementation.

A linked list is either an empty linked list, or a Link object containing a
\texttt{first} value and the \texttt{rest} of the linked list.

To check if a linked list is an empty linked list, compare it against the class
attribute \texttt{Link.empty}:
\begin{lstlisting}
if link is Link.empty:
    print('This linked list is empty!')
else:
    print('This linked list is not empty!')
\end{lstlisting}
