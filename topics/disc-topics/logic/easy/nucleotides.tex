\question
Define a set of facts about complementary nucleotides. Remember from biology that
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A}denine and \textbf{T}hymine are complementary to each other
\item \textbf{C}ytosine and \textbf{G}uanine are complementary to each other
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(fact (complementary t a))
(fact (complementary a t))
(fact (complementary c g))
(fact (complementary g c))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
