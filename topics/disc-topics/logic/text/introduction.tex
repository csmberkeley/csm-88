Over the semester, we have been using \textit{imperative programming} -- a
programming style where code is written as a set of instructions for the
computer.  In this section, we introduce \textit{declarative programming} --
code that declares \textit{what} we want, not \textit{how} to do it. Logic
programming (what we are learning) is a type of declarative programming.

In this class, we will be using a language called Logic. The Logic language
borrows syntax from Scheme and ideas from Prolog.
