\question Write simple and complex facts for {\tt every-other}, a relation
between two lists that is satisfied if and only if the second list is the same
as the first list, but with every other element removed.

\begin{lstlisting}
> (query (every-other (frodo merry sam pippin) ?x))
Success!
x: (frodo sam)
> (query (every-other (gandalf) ?x))
Success!
x: (gandalf)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.9in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(fact (every-other () ()))
(fact (every-other (?x) (?x)))
(fact (every-other (?a ?b . ?l_rest) (?a . ?r_rest))
      (every-other ?l_rest ?r_rest))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
