\question
Write facts to implement the {\tt subs} relation that relates two symbols {\tt
old} and {\tt new} with two lists {\tt input} and {\tt output}. The relation
holds whenever {\tt output} is identical to {\tt input}, except with every
occurrence of {\tt old} replaced by {\tt new}.

{\it Hint:} You may need the {\tt equal} relation from earlier.

\begin{lstlisting}
> (query (subs romeo fred (romeo oh romeo wherefore art thou romeo) ?x))
Success!
x: (fred oh fred wherefore art thou fred)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.7in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(fact (subs ?old ?new () ()))
(fact (subs ?old ?new (?old . ?rest1) (?new . ?rest2))
      (subs ?old ?new ?rest1 ?rest2))
(fact (subs ?old ?new (?x . ?rest1) (?x . ?rest2))
      (subs ?old ?new ?rest1 ?rest2)
      (not (equal ?old ?x)))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
