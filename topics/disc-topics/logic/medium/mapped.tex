\question Write simple and complex facts for {\tt mapped}, a relation between a
relation and two lists that is satisfied if and only if each element of the
second list satisfies the relation with the corresponding element of the first
list. (The example uses the {\tt complementary} fact you defined at the
beginning of discussion.)

\begin{lstlisting}
> (query (mapped complementary (g t a g t a g t a) ?nyan))
Success!
nyan: (c a t c a t c a t)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[2in]
\begin{lstlisting}
(fact (mapped ?relation () ()))
(fact (mapped ?relation (?f1 . ?r1) (?f2 . ?r2))
      (?relation ?f1 ?f2)
      (mapped ?relation ?r1 ?r2))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
