We have already been using iterables to go through the elements of a sequence.
This happens all the time in for loops. For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> for n in [1, 2, 3]:
...     print(n)
...
1
2
3
\end{lstlisting}

This works because the for loop implicitly creates an iterator using the
\lstinline$iter$ method. Python then repeatedly calls \lstinline$next$
repeatedly on the iterator, until it raises \texttt{StopIteration}. In other
words, the loop above is (basically) equivalent to:

\begin{blocksection}
\begin{lstlisting}
iterator = iter([1, 2, 3])
try:
    while True:
        n = next(iterator)
        print(n)
except StopIteration:
    pass
\end{lstlisting}
\end{blocksection}
