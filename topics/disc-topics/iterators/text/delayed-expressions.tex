We have already seen something very similar to the lazy evaluation of Streams in
another topic covered: iterators! When an iterator is created, no elements are
actually calculated. It is not until a \texttt{next} call triggers the
evaluation of the next element in the sequence. This property allows us to work
with infinite iterators, just like the infinite streams we've worked on in this
discussion. Recall the naturals generator function:

\begin{lstlisting}
def naturals():
    i = 1
    while True:
        yield i
        i += 1
\end{lstlisting}

One way to think about iterators is that they are to lists as streams are to
linked lists. They are lazy versions of each data structure.
