The \lstinline$__next__$ method checks if it has any values left in the
sequence; if it does, it computes the next element.  To return the next value in
the sequence, the \lstinline$__next__$ method keeps track of its current
position in the sequence. If there are no more values left to compute, it must
raise an exception called \lstinline$StopIteration$. This signals the end of the
sequence.

\emph{Note}: the \lstinline$__next__$ method defined in the \lstinline$Naturals$
class does \emph{not} raise \lstinline$StopIteration$ because there is no ``last
natural number''.
