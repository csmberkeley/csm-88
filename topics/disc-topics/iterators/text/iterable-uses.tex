We have already encountered functions that use and create iterables. Here are
some that we have seen (and some that we have not):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{range(start, end)} - Creates iterable of numbers from start
        (inclusive) to end (exclusive)
    \item \texttt{map(f, iterable)} - Creates iterator over f(x) for x in iterable
    \item \texttt{filter(f, iterable)} - Creates iterator over x for x in iterable if f(x)
    \item \texttt{zip(iter1, iter2)} - Creates iterator over co-indexed pairs (x, y)
    \item \texttt{reversed(iterable)} - Creates iterator sequence in reverse order
    \item \texttt{list(iterable)} - Creates a list containing all x in iterable
    \item \texttt{tuple(iterable)} - Creates a tuple containing all x in iterable
    \item \texttt{sorted(iterable)} - Creates a sorted list containing all x in iterable
\end{itemize}
