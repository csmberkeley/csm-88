An \define{iterator} is an object that tracks the position in a sequence of
values in order to provide sequential access. It returns elements one at a
time and is only good for one pass through the sequence. The following is an
example of a class that implements Python's iterator interface using two
special methods \lstinline$__next__$ and \lstinline$__iter__$. This iterator
calculates all of the natural numbers one-by-one, starting from zero:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Naturals():
    def __init__(self):
        self.current = 0

    def __next__(self):
        result = self.current
        self.current += 1
        return result

    def __iter__(self):
        return self
\end{lstlisting}
