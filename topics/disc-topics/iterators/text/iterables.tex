An \define{iterable} object is any container that can be processed sequentially.
Examples of iterables are lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. The iterable
class must implement an \lstinline$__iter__$ method, which returns an iterator.
Note that since all iterators have an \lstinline$__iter__$ method, they are all
iterable.

In general, a sequence's \lstinline$__iter__$ method will return a new iterator
every time it is called. This is because an iterator cannot be reset. Returning
a new iterator allows us to iterate through the same sequence multiple times.
