When defining an iterator, you should always keep track of current position in
the sequence. In the \lstinline$Naturals$ class, we use
\lstinline$self.current$ to save the position.

Iterator objects maintain state. Each successive call to \lstinline$__next__$
will return the next element in the sequence. Since this element may be
different from the previous one, \lstinline$__next__$ is considered
\emph{non-pure}.

Python has built-in functions called \lstinline$next$ and \lstinline$iter$ that
call \lstinline$__next__$ and \lstinline$__iter__$ respectively.

For example, this is how we could use the \lstinline$Naturals$ iterator:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
>>> nats = Naturals()
>>> next(nats)
0
>>> next(nats)
1
>>> next(nats)
2
\end{lstlisting}
