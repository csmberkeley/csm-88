Every Recursive function has three things.
\begin{enumerate}
\item One or more base cases
\item One or more ways to break the problem down into a smaller problem
\begin{itemize}
\item E.g. Given a number as input, we need to break it down into a smaller number
\end{itemize}
\item Solve the smaller problem recursively; from that, form a solution to the original problem
\end{enumerate}
