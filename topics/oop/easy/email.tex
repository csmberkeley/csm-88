\question

We now want to write three different classes, \texttt{Postman}, \texttt{Client},
and \texttt{Email} to simulate email. Fill in the definitions below to finish
the implementation!

\begin{lstlisting}
class Email:
    """Every email object has 3 instance attributes: the message,
    the sender (their name), and the addressee (the destination's
    name).
    """
    def __init__(self, msg, sender, addressee):
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
        self.msg = msg
        self.sender = sender
        self.addressee = addressee
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\pagebreak

\begin{lstlisting}
class Postman:
    """Each Postman has an instance attribute clients, which is a
    dictionary that associates client names with client objects.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.clients = {}

    def send(self, email):
        """Take an email and put it in the inbox of the client it
        is addressed to."""
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
        client = self.clients[email.addressee]
        client.receive(email)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    def register_client(self, client, client_name):
        """Takes a client object and client_name and adds it to the
        clients instance attribute.
        """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
        self.clients[client_name] = client
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\pagebreak

\begin{lstlisting}
class Client:
    """Every Client has instance attributes name (which is used
    for addressing emails to the client), mailman (which is
    used to send emails out to other clients), and inbox (a
    list of all emails the client has received).
    """
    def __init__(self, mailman, name):
        self.inbox = []
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
        self.mailman = mailman
        self.name = name
        self.mailman.register_client(self, self.name)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    def compose(self, msg, recipient):
        """Send an email with the given message msg to the given
        recipient."""
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
            email = Email(msg, self.name, recipient)
            self.mailman.send(email)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\begin{lstlisting}
    def receive(self, email):
        """Take an email and add it to the inbox of this client.
        """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1in]
\begin{lstlisting}
            self.inbox.append(email)
\end{lstlisting}
