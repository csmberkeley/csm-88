\question Write a function, \lstinline$is_leap_year$, that returns true if a number is a leap year and false otherwise.
Recall that a \emph{leap year} is either a year that's divisible by 400 or a year that's divisible by 4 and not by 100.
For example, 2000 and 2004 are leap years. 1900, 2003, and 2100 are not leap years.

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
def is_leap_year(year):
    return year % 400 == 0 or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
