What is the efficiency of \texttt{bonk}?
\begin{lstlisting}
def bonk(n):
    total = 0
    while n >= 2:
        total += n
        n = n / 2
    return total
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.0in]
  Logarithmic, because our while loop iterates at most $\log(n)$ times,
  due to $n$ being halved in every iteration. Another way of looking at this if you
  duplicate the input, we only add a single iteration to the time, which also indicates logarithmic.
\end{solution}
