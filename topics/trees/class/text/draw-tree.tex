As shown above, the tree constructor takes in a label and a list of branches (which are themselves trees).

\begin{lstlisting}

Tree(4,
    [Tree(5),
     Tree(2,
        [Tree(2),
         Tree(1)]),
     Tree(1),
     Tree(8,
        [Tree(4)])])
\end{lstlisting}

This creates a tree that looks like this:

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5, transform shape]
    \node [circle, draw] (z){$4$}
        child {node [circle, draw] (a) {$5$}}
        child {node [circle, draw] (b) {$2$}
            child {node [circle, draw] (e) {$2$}}
            child {node [circle, draw] (f) {$1$}}
        }
        child {node [circle, draw] (c) {$1$}}
        child {node [circle, draw] (d) {$8$}
            child {node [circle, draw] (g) {$4$}}
        };
\end{tikzpicture}
% \end{blocksection}
